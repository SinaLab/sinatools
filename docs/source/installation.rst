Installation
------------

You will need Python 3.10.8 (64-bit) as well as
`the Rust compiler <https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started>`_ installed.


Install using pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install nlptools, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install nlptools

This is the preferred method to install nlptools, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
